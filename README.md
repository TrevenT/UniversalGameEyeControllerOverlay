# Universal Game Eye Controller Overlay
A fun tool I hacked together in a few days to be able to control any game with my eyes using my Tobii Eye Tracker.

Tested in a few games, however I assume it would work for pretty much any game. 
The DirectX overlay may trigger some anticheats (since external wallhacks render in a simlar method), so be careful and use at own risk!

All files needed are in the repo, however after building you may need to copy some of the tobii dll's into the programs directory.

#### warning: lazy code!!
